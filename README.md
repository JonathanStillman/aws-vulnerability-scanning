# AWS Lambda Function Documentation: Vulnerability Scanning

## Purpose

The purpose of this AWS Lambda function is to conduct periodic vulnerability scans on the AWS environment using AWS Inspector. The function initiates assessment runs based on pre-configured assessment templates, facilitating the identification and reporting of security weaknesses.

## Configuration Parameters

### AWS Inspector Configuration

1. **Assessment Templates:**
   - Assessment templates are predefined configurations specifying rules packages, duration, and other parameters for vulnerability scans. This Lambda function utilizes these templates to commence assessment runs.

### Lambda Function Configuration

1. **Execution Role:**
   - The Lambda function assumes an IAM role with necessary permissions to interact with AWS Inspector, CloudWatch, and other required services. Ensure correct configuration of this role.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - The function utilizes the following environment variables for configuration:
      - `INSPECTOR_REGION`: AWS region where AWS Inspector is configured.
      - `INSPECTOR_TEMPLATE_PREFIX`: (Optional) Prefix for identifying specific assessment templates.
      - `LOG_LEVEL`: (Optional) Log level for the function (default is INFO).

3. **Scheduled Event (CloudWatch Events):**
   - The function is triggered by a CloudWatch Events rule, enabling scheduled execution. Configure the rule based on the desired scanning frequency (e.g., daily or weekly).

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **CloudWatch Logs:**
   - The function logs information to CloudWatch Logs. Logs include details about started assessment runs, errors, and other relevant information.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The Lambda function incorporates basic error handling to catch and log exceptions that may occur during execution.

### Notifications (Optional)

1. **Amazon SNS Integration:**
   - (Optional) The function can be extended to integrate with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) for sending notifications in case of identified vulnerabilities. Configure SNS topic ARNs as needed.

## Testing

To test the Lambda function locally, execute the `lambda_handler` function with sample event and context objects.

```bash
python lambda_function.py
